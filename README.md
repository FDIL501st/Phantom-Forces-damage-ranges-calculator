# Phantom-Forces-damage-ranges-calculator
Python GUI that calculates hits to kill for Phantom Forces (Roblox) guns. Have to give information about damage and damage ranges into the system, can't just search the gun up.  

Our latest release is v1.1.0. 

The ability to provide a name to the results file, and the results being orderd by increasing in kill range are the new things added. 
## How to run
Run PF_DamageRangesCalculator.py

Make sure you have all the python modules as in requirements.txt in the enviroment you are running, else the app won't run and instantly close.

You will find your saved results within a directory called Results, accessible in the same level as PF_DamageRangesCalculator.py. 
The directory gets automatically created if it doesn't already exist. Your results also shouldn't get overwritten when you save a new result.
