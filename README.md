# Phantom-Forces-damage-ranges-calculator
Python GUI that calculates hits to kill for Phantom Forces (Roblox) guns. Have to give information about damage and damage ranges into the system, can't just search the gun up.  

Currently not done. Code is still being written and the design is still up to change. Will be released when bare minimum requirements that tell hits to kill are done(meaning not a graph but just a screen showing the results).
